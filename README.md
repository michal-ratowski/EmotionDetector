# EmotionDetector
Emotion Detector with C++ and OpenCV

The aim of this software was the implementation of an algorithm capable of recognising human emotions based on images of a face or a live feed from a webcam. This was a part of a master's thesis at Warsaw University of Technology (Automatics and Robotics, Faculty of Mechatronics).

The software utilises commonly used classification algorithms for processing data â€“ support vector machines, decision trees, k-nearest neighbours algorithm, neural networks and Bayes naive classifier.

The software was developed using C++, Qt and OpenCV library.
